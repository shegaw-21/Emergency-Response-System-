Emergency Response System Simulation
Project Description
This C# application implements a sophisticated emergency dispatch simulation system that models real-world emergency response scenarios. The system intelligently matches specialized emergency units to incident types while optimizing response times and performance scoring.

Key Features
Advanced Unit-Response Matching System
Specialized Unit Classes: Five distinct emergency unit types with specific capabilities

Dynamic Response Logic: Units automatically evaluate if they can handle an incident type

Priority Handling: System selects the most appropriate available unit for each emergency

Comprehensive Incident Management
Multi-Dimensional Incidents: Each incident has type, location, and difficulty level

Realistic Simulation: Supports both automated random incidents and manual input

Geographical Diversity: Six predefined location zones with varying response challenges

Performance Optimization
Response Time Algorithm: Calculates using unit speed and incident difficulty

Adaptive Scoring System:

Base points + difficulty bonus - time penalty

Minimum zero-point protection

Real-time score tracking

Negative Scoring: Penalizes system for unhandled incidents

Technical Implementation Details
Core Architecture
Object-Oriented Design: Abstract base class with polymorphic implementations

SOLID Principles:

Single Responsibility for each unit type

Open/Closed for extendable incident types

Liskov Substitution for unit handling

Collections Framework: Leverages List<T> and LINQ for efficient unit management

Advanced Features
Type Safety: Incident type normalization (case-insensitive matching)

Input Validation: Robust checking for difficulty levels and menu selections

User Experience:

Interactive console interface

Clear operation feedback

Score tracking visibility

Scoring System
The performance metric follows this formula:

Score = BasePoints + (Difficulty × 5) - ResponseTime
Where:

BasePoints = 10

Difficulty = 1-5 (inclusive)

ResponseTime = (Difficulty × 100) / UnitSpeed

Potential Enhancements
Unit Prioritization: Implement priority queuing when multiple units are available

Distance Matrix: Incorporate actual location distances for more realistic timing

Unit Fatigue: Add usage limits or cooldown periods

Multi-Unit Responses: Support for multiple units per complex incident

Persistent Storage: Save scores and incident history to file
